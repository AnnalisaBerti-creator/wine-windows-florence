  <h1>A TOAST TO<br>THE WINE WINDOWS</h1>
  <h2>The true Florentine divas reborn in the cradle of the Renaissance</h2>
  <p class="byline">by Annalisa Berti</p>

  <p>To make this toast, you need very little: just be in Florence, keep your eyes peeled and that's it! The Buchette del Vino, or #WINE WINDOWS as they're now known around the world, are back in use. They date back to the 17th century, a time when Florence was a wine production hub and noble families owned large estates with vineyards. These small arched openings, often framed in stone, were used to sell wine by the flask directly to the public avoiding taxes and fees linked to traditional shops. Besides enabling direct sales, the wine windows also offered an advantage in terms of social distancing, especially during epidemics like the plague of 1630/1633. And it was in 2020, during the Covid 19 pandemic, that they returned to life: some Florentine establishments began using their wine windows again to serve coffee, drinks, sandwiches, and gelato in total safety.</p>

      <div class="step" id="vstep2"><p>1838: The American writer James Fenimore Cooper, known for his novel "The Last of the Mohicans", in a letter exchange published in the book "Excursions in Italy", recounts a stay in Florence, more specifically at the Ricasoli Palace, where he notes the peculiarity of a wine window used for selling wine by the flask.</p></div>

  <p>To this day, many tourists, after visiting the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, touring the Uffizi, and strolling through the Vasari Corridor, cross the Ponte Vecchio in search of a glass of Chianti served through a little window. #winewindowsflorence is the hashtag bouncing around social media, but how many of these little windows are there in the city?</p>

    <div class="scrolly-overlay">
      <div class="step" id="step1"><p>As of today, 177 wine windows have been officially recognized in the Municipality of Florence, each marked with a brass plaque certifying its authenticity by the ‚ÄúAssociazione Buchette del Vino‚Äù. From an architectural perspective, the wine windows were opened on the ground floor of palaces, easily connected to the cellar, where a servant would manage the sale of wine bottles during specific hours of the day. </p></div>
      <div class="step" id="step2"><p>Most of them are located in the historic center, where noble families once lived and produced wine on their estates outside the city. The openings were just large enough to pass a wine flask through and were almost always shaped like a small door with an arched top, often decorated with a frame featuring a drop-shaped keystone and closed with a wooden door. The elegant frames, made of smooth or rusticated stone, gave them a refined appearance, earning them the ancient nickname "wine tabernacles." </p></div>
      <div class="step" id="step3"><p>The wine windows are located precisely in Florence‚Äôs four historic districts: Santa Croce, San Giovanni, Santa Maria Novella, and Santo Spirito. We can see that the highest number of wine windows is found in the Santa Croce district. Each neighborhood has its own identity and centuries-old traditions. Santa Croce is known for its namesake basilica and for having been the district of artisans and intellectuals. San Giovanni, the heart of the city, is home to the Duomo and the Baptistery, symbols of both religious and civic power. Santa Maria Novella developed around the beautiful Renaissance basilica and was historically inhabited by merchants and travelers. Santo Spirito, on the left bank of the Arno, is the most authentic and popular neighborhood, tied to workshops, artists, and everyday Florentine life.</p></div>

  <p>The idea came in May 2020, during the lockdown, when the Vivoli gelateria, located in the heart of Florence, had the brilliant idea to reopen its wine window and serve coffee, drinks, and gelato in full anti contagion mode, an immediate success! That same May, during the lockdown, Vivoli opened its small window and began serving safely, inspiring three other establishments to follow suit: Babae on Via Santo Spirito, Osteria delle Brache in Piazza Peruzzi, and Il Latini on Via dei Palchetti.</p>

  <p>Over the years, the Associazione Culturale Buchette del Vino di Firenze has verified the authenticity of all the wine windows, marking them with a brass plaque as certification. These unique openings in the walls of Florentine buildings have been known by many names throughout the centuries, up to the present day.</p>

  <p>But the story doesn't end here, for two reasons... Quantity: The wine windows recorded so far, documented through the dataset from the Tuscany Region and the work of the Associazione Culturale Buchette del Vino di Firenze, are not all of them. Citizens, wine lovers, and enthusiasts continue to report new wine windows both in Florence and throughout the Tuscany region. Location: Thanks in part to social media, the "wine windows" have become known all over the world. Some entrepreneurs, captivated by the Florentine tradition, have even recreated these little windows in their own businesses like in New York City, specifically in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. The venue "Please Tell Me" opened its own wine window one year ago.</p>
